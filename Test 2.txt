Question 1

a)Explain characteristics of Robotic Processing Automation or RPA

-Robotic Process Automation is the use of technological applications to replicate
 the activities involved in the interactions between a human being and a UI interface of a computer.
-No programming code required, so it is a beginner friendly
-User friendly, Robotic process automation softwares are usually very easy to understand and use.
 No special kind of knowledge is needed by users in order to use RPA.
-Not disruptive, processes in RPA is very straightforward and simple.


b)Elaborate the steps you should follow to implement Robotic Process Automation

1. List out Processes To Automate,  develop a strategy to pick the right processes and then prioritize them based on metrics
2. Perform Feasibility Assessment,  evaluate to what extent the process can be automated.
3. Readjust,  identify the processes that are not structured, standardized, optimized, recorded, or not executed as planned
4. Gather User Stories,  features of an application to be built from an end-user perspective.
5. Start Development Process, create automated scripts and program code using RPA tools
6. Test RPA Process, testing to study performance in all possible scenarios and bugs
7. Reconfirm and Deploy,  confirm the results are perfect and deploy the complete RPA solution.
